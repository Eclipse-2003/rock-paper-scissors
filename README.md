# rock-paper-scissors

In this assignment i created a game of rock paper scissors that is played out in the console of your browser. This assignment uses html and an external js file to get user feedback to choose what "hand" the player will play and a random choice from the computer to get the house hand. 

This assignment uses no sort of styling on the html page itself but instead the browser prompts the user to input a selection, in which the result is displayed in the browser.

The playRound function determines a set list of 7 scenarios in which the human will play a hand and the computer will play a hand, and gives a predetermined response according to what was presented. The final else statement catches the function in case of a tie and ensures no one gets a point unfairly.
